<title> The Best Motherfucking Website </title>

 </head>

 <body>


 	<h1><strong>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</strong>  </h1> 
 	<p>Really, it is.</p>
 	<p><h2><strong>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</strong></h2></p>

 	 <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class= "web">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span> is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
 <p> <strong><span class= "wrong"><U>WRONG</U></span></strong>, motherfucker.</p>

 <p><h2><strong>The best kick-ass website</strong></h2></p> <p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <strong> <span class= "web2">motherfuckingwebsites:</span></strong></p>

  <ul>
 	<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
 	<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than <a href="https://google.com"> the Google home page</a></li>
 	<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
 	<li><span class="bling">Looks almost the same on every screen</span></li>
 	<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it <span class= "problem">without any problem well</span> ,kind of </li>
 	<li>It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</li>
 	<li>Shit is even <span class="legible">more legible</span> than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style </li>
 	<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use IPoAC</li>
 	<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this <span class= "ass">ass-breaking</span> font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li> 
 	
 </ul>


<p><h2><strong>Well guess what, motherfucker:</strong></h2></p>
<p>This website is even better than <a href="This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.">the last guy</a> and <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">the guy before him.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>It's over a secure connection
	<img src="html_mini.jpg" class="immageflottante" alt="html_mini" />  - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>	
<li>It doesn't use a single media query well, <span class="really">not really</span></li>


</ul>

 <p><h1><strong>Put even less contrast</strong></h1></p>

 <p>Yeah, a <strong>&#9632 #444 </strong> is cool but a <strong> &#9632 #454545 </strong> is better.

 	<p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="web3">motherfuckingwebsite.</span></p>

 	<p><h2><strong>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</strong></h2></p>

<p> Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

<p><h2><strong>Put some pictures</strong></h2></p>


<p>

	</figure>
</p>
<p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a context. The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
<p class= "dessous"> A cat burger, just to keep the context of the website.</p>

<p><h2><strong>Yes, even this is satire.</strong></h2></p>
<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, requests (with a small size) = faster load time!</p>

<p><h2><strong>Author</strong></h2></p>

<p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali">be followed on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/"> followed on GitHub</a> or contacted <a href="https://denv.it">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a></p>

Don't worry, it can be read in less than 30 seconds, unless you have some sort of reading disability - in that case, I'm wondering why you're still reading this text. Really. Stop. Please. I mean, seriously. Why are you still reading? </p>
